# KPSC Computer Teachers (CST) — 2-Week Prep Plan

> Backup-plan prep, built on an ECE (VTU, 2018 scheme) background + 1.5 yrs Boeing India (Systems Engineering) + 4-5 months Golang backend internship.
> Self-assessed: **strong** in Data Structures & Algorithms and AI basics. **Everything else treated as fresh**, including the rest of Paper 2's CS core.

---

## 0. Exam Shape (from official syllabus)

| Paper | Sections |
|---|---|
| **Paper 1 (General)** | GK, Current Affairs, ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ ಕನ್ನಡ (Kannada), General English, Educational Psychology (ಶೈಕ್ಷಣಿಕ ಮನೋವಿಜ್ಞಾನ), Computer Literacy, Health Education (ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ), Value Education (ಮೌಲ್ಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ) |
| **Paper 2 (CST — Computer Science)** | 10 units: Fundamentals of Computers → AI |

**Strategy for the 14 days:** front-load the Paper 2 CS units (your natural strength as an engineer, even where topics are technically "fresh" — you'll absorb them faster than a non-CS candidate), then dedicate focused blocks to the Paper 1 sections that have zero overlap with your engineering background (Educational Psychology, Kannada grammar, Value/Health Education), and close with GK/Current Affairs + full revision + mocks.

## 5. Obsidian Setup Tips

- Create a `KPSC-CST` folder with subfolders `Paper1/` and `Paper2/`
- One note per unit, tagged `#kpsc-cst/paper2/unitN` or `#kpsc-cst/paper1/<topic>`
- Maintain a single **MOC (Map of Content)** note linking every unit note, checked off as completed
- Keep a running **`Weak Spots.md`** note — append anything you get wrong during MCQ practice; this becomes your Day 14 revision list
- Use the Excalidraw plugin for diagrams (OSI layers, memory hierarchy, ER diagrams) — visual recall helps under exam time pressure
